1. To generate the database, open visual studio's SQL Server Object Explorer. Please create a database named QLessTransportDB under SQL Server > (localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB.

2. Once you have created the database, right click on Databases and click on "Publish Data-tier Application".

3. On the "File on disk" input, click on Browse and select the .dacpac file that I have included in the solution folder.

4. On the "Target database connection" input, click on Edit, then locate the new QLessTransportDB that you have just created.

5. Click on "Publish". Then if there is a prompt, just click "Yes".
